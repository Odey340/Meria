# The Gauntlet

Old monitoring scripts go in. Verified new ones come out. Along the way, the process finds real problems in the data hall that the old scripts were hiding.

**HackUTD 2026 · tracks: NMC² · 8090 · NVIDIA Nemotron**

| Step | What happens | Who decides |
|---|---|---|
| **Read** | Nemotron Super reads a real Nagios check (plugin + config) and writes a plain-English rule card. The real plugin binary is then run to confirm every threshold statement. | Execution |
| **Find** | The old check is replayed over 21 days of recorded readings. Deterministic detectors find what it hid (a lying sensor, a clogged filter, a dead mailbox, a retired rack). Nemotron Nano writes each as two sentences and an action. | A person accepts (→ work order) or dismisses |
| **Prove** | Nemotron Super writes Prometheus rules. The verifier runs the real plugin on every value the sensor can report and on generated timing traces, and compares with `promtool`. A one-shot translation goes through the same verifier and fails with concrete counterexamples; the Gauntlet loop feeds them back until zero. | A person signs the certificate; then the tombstone |

Nemotron writes sentences and rules. Execution decides whether they're right. That is the answer to "isn't this just pasting the script into an LLM?"

## Run it

```bash
# backend
cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt && cp .env.example .env   # add your NVIDIA_API_KEY from build.nvidia.com
make promtool                                                           # fetches promtool into backend/bin
python -m app.smoke                                                     # one Super call, one Nano call
# frontend
cd frontend && npm install
# both
make dev          # backend :8000, frontend :5173
```

Open http://localhost:5173/#/ for the fixture-driven UI (no backend needed), or http://localhost:5173/?source=api#/ to run against the backend.

**Modes** (`GAUNTLET_MODE` in `backend/.env`): `live` calls Nemotron and caches every response · `cached` serves the cache only (demo with Wi-Fi off; run `make warm` first) · `mock` serves fixtures. The badge in the top bar always shows which. The verifier (plugin + promtool) runs locally in every mode.

**Legacy plugin.** The verifier runs whatever `LEGACY_PLUGIN` points at and reads its exit code. On the demo machine: `sudo apt install monitoring-plugins-basic` and `LEGACY_PLUGIN=/usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_snmp`. Without it, `legacy/check_snmp` is a stand-in with the same Monitoring Plugins range semantics (see `legacy/README.md`).

**Model IDs.** `backend/app/models.py` has defaults; copy the exact current Nemotron IDs from build.nvidia.com into `NEMOTRON_SUPER` / `NEMOTRON_NANO`.

**Real work orders.** Set `GAUNTLET_GITHUB_REPO=owner/repo` (with `gh auth login`) and Accept opens a GitHub issue.

## Demo (2 minutes)

1. **Checks** → open `check_rack_inlet`.
2. **Read** → *Read with Nemotron*. Watch statements verify by execution (`27.1 → WARNING ✓`). Director toggle shows a flagged statement.
3. **Find** → *Replay and find*. Six findings. Hand the judge the mouse: `A` accepts, `D` dismisses. Work order #482 opens.
4. **Prove** → *Generate and verify*. Coverage strip over every value. One-shot: 3 counterexamples. Gauntlet: 0. "Same model both times. The difference is the proof." `S` signs off → tombstone.
5. **Handoff** → everything the shift decided, with names and times.

Keyboard: `1–5` screens · `A` accept · `D` dismiss · `S` sign off · `U` undo · `→` next step · `?` help · `Ctrl+Shift+D` Director (replay, jump to end, planned failures, speed).

## Layout

```
frontend/   React + Vite + Tailwind. src/screens (Checks, Read, Find, Prove, Handoff), src/data (DataSource, Mock, Api), src/fixtures
backend/    FastAPI. app/main.py (SSE endpoints), app/llm.py (Nemotron via build.nvidia.com, cache), app/verify (sweep.py, traces.py), app/prompts
legacy/     the real Nagios config for check_rack_inlet, inventory.csv, oncall_roster.csv, plugin stand-in, README with declared drift
.cursor/    build rules used to design this (domain, UX, design system, engine, verification UI, Nemotron API, QA)
PROMPT.md   the build prompt
```

## Honest limits

- Guaranteed on the stated domain and timing model, not "correct forever". The certificate says what is not covered.
- Timing equivalence uses a Python model of Nagios soft/hard states; check it against a real Nagios Core before claiming more.
- The replay and findings run on a simulated 21-day recording with realistic ranges; the plugin, promtool and the verifier are real.
